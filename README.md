# Merge Sort in C++

## 📌 Overview

This C++ program demonstrates the **Merge Sort** algorithm, an efficient, stable, divide-and-conquer sorting method:

1. Divides the array into two halves recursively.
2. Sorts each half individually.
3. Merges the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

It displays the array before and after sorting to help visualize how merge sort organizes the elements.

## 🔧 Features

- **Divide and Conquer**: Recursively splits and merges arrays for efficient sorting.

- **Stable Sorting**: Preserves the order of equal elements.

- **Array Input**: Works with any array of integers defined in the code.

- **Fully Commented Code**: Easy to understand and modify.
