# Merge Sort in C++

## 📌 Overview

This C++ program demonstrates the **Merge Sort** algorithm, an efficient, stable, divide-and-conquer sorting method:

1. Divides the array into two halves recursively.
2. Sorts each half individually.
3. Merges the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

It displays the array before and after sorting to help visualize how merge sort organizes the elements.

## 🔧 Features

- **Divide and Conquer**: Recursively splits and merges arrays for efficient sorting.

- **Stable Sorting**: Preserves the order of equal elements.

- **Array Input**: Works with any array of integers defined in the code.

- **Fully Commented Code**: Easy to understand and modify.

## 📋 Example Run

**Input:**
Original array:
38 27 43 3 9 82 10

**Output:**
Sorted array:
3 9 10 27 38 43 82

## ⚙ How It Works

1. **Divide the Array**
   - Recursively split the array into two halves until each sub-array has one element.
2. **Sort Each Half**
   - Recursively sort both halves of the array.
3. **Merge Halves**
   - Merge the sorted halves into one sorted array by comparing elements.
4. **Repeat**
   - Continue until the whole array is merged and sorted.
